## Project Objectives
For this project, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis, practicing your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python.

Using your pandas skills, complete a series of guided prompts exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv). IMDB stands for "the Internet Movie Database," an online collection of film information and reviews.
 
In these exercises, you will be looking to answer such questions as: 

- What is the average rating per genre?
- How many different actors are in a movie?

The IMDB dataset provided is created from data scraped from the [Internet Movie Database website](https://www.imdb.com). The dataset describes top ranking movies, including: title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter-code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Markdown cells as needed.
   - In the Markdown cells, describe any assumptions you made to solve these problems.
4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **advanced** and **bonus** sections for additional challenge!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done by:

 - Creating a submissions repository in your GA GitHub Enterprise workspace, uploading your materials, and adding your instructors as collaborators to your repo under Settings->Collaborators & teams.
